# LLMs Strategic Architect

A specialized GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) tool for startups to control how they are indexed by AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT.

### Why this is important
* **GEO Advantage**: AI crawlers prioritize low-noise data; this tool creates an `llms.txt` file that provides a high density of information in a format AI agents are designed to read.
* **Brand Authority**: It uses "Entity-rich" labeling to help LLMs identify key facts quickly, reducing hallucinations and ensuring your core value prop is communicated accurately.
* **Zero Dependencies**: The script is written in pure Python and requires no external APIs or libraries to run, making it lightweight and secure for any startup stack.

### How to use
1. Edit the `MY_COMPANY` and `MY_URL` variables in `architect.py`.
2. Run the script: `python architect.py`.
3. Upload the generated `llms.txt` to your website's root directory.
